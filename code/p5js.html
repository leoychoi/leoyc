                I was first introduced to <a href='https://processing.org/'>Processing</a> during a visualizations course in college, where we used it to create interactive data visualizations.
                <br><br>
                A few years down the line, I came across p5.js, a JavaScript adaptation of Processing. That discovery was my entrypoint to creative coding, and I've since enjoyed using p5.js to explore the intersection of code and art.

                <p>p5.js is a JavaScript library for creative coding, with a focus on making coding accessible and inclusive for artists, designers, educators, beginners, and anyone else! p5.js is free and open-source because we believe software, and the tools to learn it, should be accessible to everyone.</p>

                            This clock combines aspects of digital clocks and calendars. Each unit of time trickles down to ultimately replace the current one.
                            Significant solar and lunar milestones are displayed; it'd probably be more useful to display events from your Google Calendar but also much more stressful.

                            The base photo is one that I took in Red Hook, Brooklyn. The orange accents in the scene were both striking and dreamlike, and I tried to capture those feelings in this sketch.
                            The orange flowers are carried across the canvas in a wind-like flow field that utilizes Perlin noise, and the shimmering dots increasingly distort the sketch as it plays.
