                During the summer of 2022, I took a course in Risograph printing at the School of Visual Arts's <a href='https://risolab.sva.edu/'>RisoLAB</a> in NYC.
                <br><br>
                I learned how to design and prepare digital works for printing virtually, and then also followed up with in person lab sessions to learn how to operate the Risograph.

                <p>A Risograph is a compact, high speed printer made by the Riso Kagaku Corporation of Japan... Designs are printed in individual spot color layers, which are passed through paper stencils that are automatically created and wrapped around ink-filled drum cylinders... The Risograph’s speed, low cost of materials, ease of use, and vivid spot colors make it the perfect tool for printing and publishing small editions of zines, prints, books, and flyers.</p>

                            This is a doodle I made early on while learning about how different color layers interact. I wanted to create a southwestern color palette for the background; there's an orange gradient from the top down and a yellow gradient from the bottom up.
                            Ultimately, the dither pattern (the diffusion of dots that reproduce the image) caused the print to lose a lot of the photo's detail. Oh well, it was a good learning experience.

                            This is a poster I made for my niece as a housewarming gift. The letters were created from photos of big inflatable balloons from her 1st birthday party.
                            At the time of printing, I didn't have access to a Risograph so this was printed by the very friendly people at <a href='https://www.txtbooks.us/'>txtbooks.us</a>.
